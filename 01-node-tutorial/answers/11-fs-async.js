//This should load the fs module, and use the asynchronous function writeFile to write 3 lines to a file
// ./temporary/fileB.txt. Now, be careful here! 
//First, you need to use the "append" flag for all but the first line.
//Second, each time you write a line to the file, you need to have a callback, because the writeFile operation is asynchronous.
//Third, for each line you write, you need to do the write for the line that follows it within the callback - otherwise the operations wonâ€™t happen in order
